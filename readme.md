# Hobbies & Interests

I love technology. I think I’m glutton for new technology. Especially in web-development where the landscape keeps on changing very fast. If I don’t keep up, I risk becoming obsolete. I also like sketching and reading books. But I’m not really an outgoing personality. I expect introversion is quite common when it comes to programmers, though.
